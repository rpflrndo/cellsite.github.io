<h2>Call Flow Script</h2>

<div class="section script">
<strong>Opening</strong><br>
Hi, good morning! How are you doing?
</div>

<div class="section script">
<strong>Decision Maker Check</strong><br>
This is (Agent Name) from TowerPoint, and based on our system you're the one who handles and makes decisions with the cell tower lease in (City), right?
</div>

<div class="section script">
<strong>Reason for the Call</strong><br>
The reason why I'm calling today is that my director is the new director of business development for your wireless coverage area, and he would like to make sure that you are making the most out of your cell tower lease.
</div>

<div class="section script">
<strong>Site Status</strong><br>
To confirm, your site remains active, right?<br>
If unsure: Are you still collecting rent or payments from the tower itself?
</div>

<div class="section script">
<strong>Transfer</strong><br>
If this is a good time for you, and for the specifics, I can connect you to (DA NAME), our director. Please hold.
</div>

<div class="section script">
<strong>If Director Does Not Answer</strong><br>
Thank you for patiently waiting. My director is wrapping up a quick call with another site owner in your area and will personally call you back within the next 15 minutes.
</div>

<div class="section script">
<strong>15-Minute Appointment</strong><br>
Can you stay available in the next 15 minutes so you don’t miss the call?<br>
May I also get your email address so I can forward it to my director?
</div>

That's why I'm calling about, (continue with RFC or qualifying)`,

he will explain why you are getting these calls about your cell site lease, (continue with qualifying or attempt transfer if already qualified)`,
